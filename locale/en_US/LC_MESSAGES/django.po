msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:22
msgid ""
"En-trak™ is a cloud-based energy management analytics software built to help "
"organizations to reduce their energy use, through continuous monitoring, "
"analytics, alarms, reports, awareness and control."
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:24
msgid "2. What does En-trak™ measure?"
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:25
msgid ""
"En-trak™ measures the electricity consumption of your building or office in "
"real-time (every 60 seconds). In most cases, we will breakdown your total "
"electricity consumption into different components by sources - e.g. "
"Lighting, Aircon, Socket; or by areas - e.g. Block A, Block B. The actual "
"circuits measured at your site depend on your requirements and the actual "
"electrical layout of your building."
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:27
msgid "3. Where is our En-trak™ system installed?"
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:28
msgid ""
"The En-trak™ metering equipment is typically installed in a building’s or "
"office main switch room where the power comes in from the utility’s power "
"station and distributes to different parts of the building. In areas "
"requiring more detailed data points, metering equipment may also be "
"installed in other sub-metering locations throughout the building."

msgid "4. Can we use En-trak™ offline?"
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:31
msgid ""
"En-trak™ is a web-based software system and cannot be accessed offline. "
"However, you can easily download and save your energy information into PDF "
"or Excel for offline viewing and analysis."

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:34

msgid ""
"7. Why is the energy data from En-trak™ reports different from my monthly "
"bills?"
msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:40
msgid ""
"To compare the energy data, we need to ensure we are looking at the same "
"period and time of cut-off. By default, En-trak™ shows your monthly energy "
"reports based on a full calendar month i.e. from 1 March to 31 March. "
"However, your electricity bills may have different start/end dates e.g. "
"March 24 – April 25. En-trak™ energy data for any specified time range are "
"calculated from midnight (0000hrs) to midnight (0000hrs), whereas utility "

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:46

"Food energy is usually measured in calories. Electrical energy is usually "
"measured in kilowatt-hours. Because both food and electricity are energy "
"unit and by converting electrical energy use (kWh) into calories of "
"different types of food, it allows occupants to imagine how many burgers "
"their building, school, or office would have to eat to consume enough energy "
