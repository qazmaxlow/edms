msgstr ""

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:25
msgid ""
"En-trak™ measures the electricity consumption of your building or office in "
"real-time (every 60 seconds). In most cases, we will breakdown your total "
"electricity consumption into different components by sources - e.g. "
"Lighting, Aircon, Socket; or by areas - e.g. Block A, Block B. The actual "
"circuits measured at your site depend on your requirements and the actual "
"electrical layout of your building."

#: entrak/templates/faq.html:28
msgid ""
"The En-trak™ metering equipment is typically installed in a building’s or "
"office main switch room where the power comes in from the utility’s power "

"installed in other sub-metering locations throughout the building."

"To compare the energy data, we need to ensure we are looking at the same "
